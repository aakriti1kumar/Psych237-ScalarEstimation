Psych 237 - Model-based wisdom of the crowds in scalar estimation tasks

Model-based wisdom of the crowds in scalar-estimation tasks.

We use experimental data from Fiechter & Kornell 2021: Participants viewed a box containing asterisks (*) on a computer screen. They completed 60 trials in total, ten trials each of six different set sizes (50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 stars). The order of these 60 trials was randomly determined for each participant and the positioning of the stars was randomly determined on each trial. Participants viewed the star-filled box for 2 sseconds; the box was then removed from the screen and participants were asked to estimate the number of stars present in the box. Participants were 63 people recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk service.
